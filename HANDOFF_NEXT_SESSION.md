# Handoff — Next Session

1. Read all project-state documents and inspect repository `Angel2222522/Android-Device-Control-Center`, branch `main`, current HEAD.
2. Phase 1 foundation passed CI and physical Android 16 installation/launch.
3. Phase 2 PR #1 passed CI and merged as `0ddf03c2d9b2f08c364b791ad91eb1d8df3d24e9`.
4. The first update failed because separate CI runners used different ephemeral debug certificates.
5. Stable signing passed two independent CI builds and explicit certificate verification; PR #3 merged as `e1d78cea001f0da8769ccf2db70eb6296407ec20`.
6. User removed the old build once, clean-installed the stable-signed Phase 2 APK and supplied screenshots confirming successful launch and real telemetry rendering.
7. Physical observations: RAM 3.53 GB total / 1.13 GB available / 0.42 GB low threshold / low flag false; storage 101.76 GB total / 28.54 GB available; thermal headroom 1.02 with “serious” label; special accesses not granted.
8. Do not treat thermal interpretation as correct until official semantics and device behavior are checked.
9. Compare values with Android system information.
10. Produce a subsequent stable-signed checkpoint and verify it installs over the current app without uninstalling.

**Current production code:** real RAM/thermal/storage/access snapshot; no diagnosis engine.  
**Verified:** CI, stable certificate, clean install, launch and telemetry rendering.  
**First unfinished point:** validate displayed telemetry semantics, especially thermal status/headroom.
